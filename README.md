# IdeenMemoorje
IdeenMemoorje is a small webserver that can be used as a plattform for submitting and collecting highly customisable forms. Its name is a compound word composed of the East Frisian words for ideas (Ideen) and memory (Memoorje), which can be translated as “memory of ideas”.  Users can access the system via an automatically generated link that allows them to fill in and submit a form. Administrators can then download these forms for further usage. That structure of these forms can be altered by administrators, who are also able to access and modify the system remotely.
For network functionality, the system uses CivetWeb and to implement the PDF-functionality to generate PDF summaries of the submitted forms, it uses libHaru. The system also makes use of the OpenSSL library in order to implement HTTPS.
